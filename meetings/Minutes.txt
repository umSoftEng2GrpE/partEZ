Brainstomed ideas for the project:
Study partner app to find study partners
Note Sharing app for university students
Party Planning app like facebooks events section but with more functionality
iClicker app for schools
Election voting app for all elections (UMSU to Federal, etc)
Finance organizer app to keep track of spending habits
Chat app like slack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 13, 2016
Discussed how to use the repos and forks
Trying to decide on project
Focused on the 3 favored ideas:
Note Sharing App
•	Why Not?
•	Hard to get buy-in
•	Not top priority
Party Planning
•	App to plan events
•	Like facebook events
•	Do more than the facebook 
•	Chat specific to the event
•	Facebook login
•	Doodle poll style set up
•	Seems like the best idea	
iClicker app/voting
•	Kind of separate
•	Voting = elections (u of m, civic, etc)
•	One user creates what you vote for
•	Other users are able to vote
•	iClicker has less security
Finance Organizer 
•	not easy to get info from Bank/Credit Card
•	Nope
Chat App
•	Talk with people on the same wifi network
•	Already libraries that do it

Focusing on iClicker and Party Planning:
Features:
Party/Event Planner:
- Suggest by location (open parties)
- FB login
- Chat
- Vendors (catering, event locations)
	- ads (rate them)
- User ratings (bars, event centers)
- doodle style poll
- who's bringing what?
- invites
Market is huge, uni students party, fixes other apps probs
iClicker:
- graphs for results
- history tracking
- live feedback
- questions on screen
- link to uni accounts
Directly applicable to current market
Improvement
CONS:
iClicker:
- Tiny Market
- harder to market
Party Planning:
- FB app ID
- competing with Facebook
- Scalability
- Too broad
- Login or not?
Technologies:
- PHP backend
- JavaScript frontend
- Laravel
- MySQL
- Maven? maybe just for java
- Composer
- Gulp
- Fitnesse (Acceptance testing) or codeception
- Do Mavn and Gulp scale?
